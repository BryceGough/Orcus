Orcus Media Library
===================

What is Orcus?
--------------
Orcus is a open source media library that will be able to play lots of types of media easily from .NET applications.

How does it work?
-----------------
Orcus utilizes the Media Control Interface to play media. It will soon use more than just the Media Control Interface as I add further additions to what the library can do.

What will be added?
-------------------
As I have only just started this library it can only play audio at this time, however, I have plans to add the following in the near future:

- Audio (Recording)
- Video (Playback for now)
- MIDI (Input/Output/Recording)
- ...
